            <p> From childhood to now, I've always been surrounded by art - and I've grown to love it.
                Back when I was 9 years old with my little Ipad, my YouTube for you page would be filled with
                videos from the art channel "Draw so cute" and I would draw draw drawwww. I loved DIY and making
                things out of my own hand and everybody knew it because my presents for people would always be handmade 
                little trinkets out of bottle caps and cardboard. So if I ever give you a handmade gift, know that
                that is my highest form of expressing my love lol (definitely not just broke).

            <p> Yep. This was where I started out.
                I remember randomly getting the courage to post my art on youtube - 
                I've thought about doing it for a while, contemplating, being held Back
                by the fear of being judged.
            </p>

            <p> ~ Around August 2024 ~ </p>

            <p> I figured that the only way to combat the fear was to expose myself
                to it constantly. So I subjected myself to a 100 day drawing challenge.
            </p>

            <p> I liked the feel and simplicity of the soft graphite pencil, on my sketchbook page,
                as I drew faces - and soon, hands (oh no! the artists' worst nightmare).
            </p>

            <p> I found motivation in drawing the things I liked. At the time, it was anime.</p>

            <p> I'm gonna let you in on a little secret just between the 2 of us.
                I never finished the 100 day challenge :/  
                So I failed. But I'd say I needed to because I couldn't stay consistent with 
                waking up at 5am everyday to draw. There was just- no way. 
            </p>

            <p> I did learn a ton of lessons from the experience though. The most important was
                that "if I can do it once, I can do it again". The more you do something, the easier it
                gets. The fear disappears.
