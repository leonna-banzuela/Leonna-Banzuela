                <p class="phy_desc"> While I love the creative side of things, I also recently discovered my fascination 
                    for equations, numbers, and the logical explanation behind how the world functions. It's both magical 
                    and crazy to me.

                    I've competed in an engineering competition made by AUT. Although
                    my chances of winning is quuuiiiittteeee slim, it was fun to be immersed in research and
                    calculations for a whole day (lots of eating snacks and taking long breaks too though heheh).

                <p class="archi_header"> Architecture &lt;3 </p>
                <p class="archi_desc1"> What's the best fit for someone who thrives in both math and drawing?
                    According to my calculations, the right answer would be Arichitecture~. This is the career
                    path that aim currently aiming for as my plan B (plan A undecided :/). I'm enjoying it a lot so
                    far, being in Visual Comms class, studying the forms of buildings and taking inspiration from 
                    seeminly unrelated, but meaningful things.
                </p>
                <p class="archi_desc2"> One concern I have - which I think we all have too - is the rise of AI.
                    "Will AI take over my job?" Thats a real concern. I hope AI doesnt take over Architecture TvT.
                    But whatever happens, I like to believe that AI will do us more good, and give us plenty of room
                    to be able to communicate our ideas and bring them to life.

                <p class="digitech_desc1"> Year 11 digital tech has been one of my favourite subjects so far in all my
                    years in school. I love how it challenges me to think in a different way that stimulates the 
                    problem-solving parts of my brain. This year, one of the most valuable skill I've learnt is how to code 
                    in phyton, even though its just the basics.
                </p>

                <p class="digitech_desc2">
                    There's this quote I like: "trust the process". Its been so "gen-z-ed" these days, but I genuinely trusted
                    the process when I started out and didn't know a single thing and even felt behind at times. 
                </p>

                <p class="digitech_desc3">
                    I might've overcomplicated things for my phyton assesment... so I only got a merit at the end TvT.
                    But I really had fun with it and developed a good understanding of the nature of the code that I wouldn't have 
                    been able to if I didn't experiment and try a bunch of new, challenging stuff.
                </p>

                <p class="webdes_header"> Web Design &lt;3 </p>
                <p class="webdes_desc1"> 
                    Not gonna lie, I enjoyed python a lot more than creating figma designs TvT. It was cool to see how my website 
                    could look, but I wanted to bring it to life. But thats okay because I got to make this website so I'm satisfies now 
                    heheh.
                </p>
                <p class="webdes_desc2"> 
                    The assesment I've enjoyed THE MOST is this one by far - web development. Phython got me the right mindset for solving 
                    problems with code, and web design helped me to know how a website should be laid out for maximum function and aesthetics.
                    Overall, thanks to 11DT, I've acquired skills that can easily be integrated to other areas of life, and they'll definitely 
                    be helpful in the future.
